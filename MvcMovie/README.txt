TASK 4: -

I made a lot of files in the view for this task. I changed the title, footer, and menu link in 
views/shared/_Layout.cshtml so that the title on the browser tab shows a different word. 
Instead of Privacy Policy - MvcMovie, there is Privacy Policy - Movie App. 
Once that was done, the content of the _viewstart.cshtml file was changed.After that, I changed the 
view's index.cshtml file to give the page a title like "My Movie List." 

TASK 5: -

For this task, I made a file called welcome.cshtml in views/Helloworld. 
I used the viewdata dictionary to make it and then sent it to the view. 
The view then sends the info to the viewer as HTML.

TASK 6: -

Movie.cs is the name I gave to the class that I added to the models folder as part of this task. 
There is an ID field in the movie class, which is necessary for the database to have in order to 
generate the primary key. After that, a new scaffolded item should be added to the controllers folder.
